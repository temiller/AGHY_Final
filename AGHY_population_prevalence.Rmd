#Purpose
I am interested to look at the prevelance dynamics a little differently than we have in the past. I have some ideas for new ways to visualize the data that I would like to try. This file does not do any new computations or model fitting, just runs with the Bayesian fits that we have already completed and saved. Starting with a load of the RData file that includes the most recent fit of the big model. This is is the Dropbox but not on git.

```{r load Bayesian output, echo=T}
load("C:/Users/tm9/Dropbox/AGHY_SFAEF_Project/AGHY analysis summer2017/AGHY_Final/AGHY_Bayes.RData")
```
